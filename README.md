# fitbit-dataset-analysis-prediction
#### The chances of a mistake being commited while working out is predicted on the fitbit dataset
####  The data was analysed and cleaned.
#### there were useless columns filled with Null values which were removed.
#### helper comments are present
####  decision tree, random forest classification were used and compare.
##### we can see that the confusion matrix of random forest classification has more zeroes on non diagonal positions compared to confusion matrix of dtree. therefore, random forest classification is better in this case.
#### formed dtree is attached in the form of pdf.
#### input dataset is also uploaded in csv format.
sklearn,pydotplus,pandas libraries were used.
